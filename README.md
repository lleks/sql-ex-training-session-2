## SQL training session from sql-ex.ru, "SHIPS" db

Short database description "Ships":

The database of naval ships that took part in World War II is under consideration.

The database consists of the following relations:

Classes(class, type, country, numGuns, bore, displacement)

- Ships(name, class, launched)
- Battles(name, date)
- Outcomes(ship, battle, result)

Ships in classes all have the same general design.

A class is normally assigned either the name of the first ship built according to the corresponding design, or a name that is different from any ship name in the database.

The ship whose name is assigned to a class is called a lead ship.

The Classes relation includes:

- name of the class
- type (can be either bb for a battle ship, or bc for a battle cruiser)
- country the ship was built in
- the number of main guns
- gun caliber (bore diameter in inches)
- displacement (weight in tons).

The Ships relation holds information about:

- ship name
- name of its corresponding class
- year the ship was launched.

The Battles relation contains:

- names
- dates of battles the ships participated in

Outcomes relation - the battle result for a given ship (may be sunk, damaged, or OK, the last value meaning the ship survived the battle unharmed).

Notes:

1) The Outcomes relation may contain ships not present in the Ships relation.
2) A ship sunk canâ€™t participate in later battles.
3) For historical reasons, lead ships are referred to as head ships in many exercises.
4) A ship found in the Outcomes table but not in the Ships table is still considered in the database. This is true even if it is sunk.
